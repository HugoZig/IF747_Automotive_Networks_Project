# IF747_Automotive_Networks_Project
Project Developed in Automotive Networks course at CIn/UFPE

This repository contains code developed for a project in the automotive networks course at the Center for Informatics at UFPE (Federal University of Pernambuco). This project aims to develop software for an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) that creates a defensive system for a CAN bus that may be under attack. For this system, message ID verification, timestamp verification, and an attempt to develop a machine learning model for detecting malicious messages based on their payload were carried out. The latter was not completely finalized and still has certain flaws.
